# Honeybee

This is my very first project from when I first started to code. Created around 2012.

## About

Honeybee is a small browser game where you control a hungry bee on the search for delicious berries. By using the arrow keys you move step by step on a small grid where trees block your path and bushed hide the precious fruits, which can be picked using the spacebar. 

Beware the clouds! Touching rain will cost you a life, which you only have three of.

After picking all berries you must return to the hive savely to progress to the next level.
